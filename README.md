Simple game made with Unity3D in C#

The game aim is to get the best score by making the ball jump between the platforms.
Some of those platform are different, yellow ones slow down the ball, red ones will make it boost making it very difficult to control!
At some points you can see the green power-ups, that give you the ability to jump while in the air.
